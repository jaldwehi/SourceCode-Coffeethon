# Coffeethon 2025 – Hackathon Website

A responsive, interactive landing page for the **Coffeethon 2025 Hackathon**, built as part of the **Software Maintenance and Evolution** course. The site showcases hackathon details, countdown, tracks, sponsor highlights, FAQs, and more — all styled and structured for extensibility and collaboration.

## 🚀 Purpose of the Project

This project was designed to simulate a real-world web development workflow with a strong focus on:

- **Version control using Git and GitHub**
- **Issue tracking and team coordination via Jira**
- **Applying key software maintenance concepts** (modifiability, readability, reusability)
- **Working in branches, managing merge conflicts, and handling real updates**
- **Delivering front-end improvements using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
